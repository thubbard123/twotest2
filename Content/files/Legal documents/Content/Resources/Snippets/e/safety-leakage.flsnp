        <p class="Bold">Leakage Current!</p>
        <p>Since the leakage current to PE is more than 3.5 mA, in compliance with IEC61800-5-1 the PE connection must either be doubled or a connecting cable with a cross-section &gt;10 mm² must be used. Deviating measures according to regional standards might be possible.</p>
